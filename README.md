This is a demo for show how to use 'pytorch lightning' to help accelerate constructing and training a deep learning model. It shows the most helpful function of the lib and they are **'recording logs'**, **'auto-saving checkpoint'**, **'early stopping'**, **'learning-rate scheduling'**, etc.

Q: How to run this demo?

A: So easy! Just run ``python scripts/train_mnist.py`` at the root directory.

Tips: If your python can't find a package, just use conda or pip to install it! ðŸ˜‚
